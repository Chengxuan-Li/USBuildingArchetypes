# USBuildingArchetypes


## Planned for feature releases

- [ ] Make separate and reproduceable workflows for clustering and for prediction.
- [X] Move utiliy functions to external `.py` file=
- [X] Use k-fold CV for classifier performance evaluation and model selection.
- [ ] Consider hyper-parameter search in classifier performance evaluation and model selection.
- [ ] Deploy the RECS-based archetype workflow to all Coppen climate zones in the United States
- [ ] A release of all readily useable building archetypes for the U.S., including guides to generalize/tweak parameters for usage in other countries and territories
- [ ] Deploy the archetype workflow for CBECS
- [ ] Normalize thermal loads EUI agaist HDD65 and CDD55 (?)
- [ ] Examine how catboost predicts based on incomplete features
- [ ] Mechanism to merge archetypes?
- [ ] Racing conditions: excol has equipment info, archetype has contradictionary equipment info


## Possible journal discussion points

First implement archetypes for all climate zones.
- [ ] How does building age say about the impact on archetype assignment, in general? Are there any regional differences?
- [ ] Which regions (climate zones) have more archetypes
